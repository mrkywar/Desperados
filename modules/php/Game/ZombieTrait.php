      zombieTurn:

      This method is called each time it is the turn of a player who has quit the game (= "zombie" player).
      You can do whatever you want in order to make sure the turn of this player ends appropriately
      (ex: pass).

      Important: your zombie code will be called when the player leaves the game. This action is triggered
      from the main site and propagated to the gameserver from a server, not from a browser.
      As a consequence, there is no current player associated to this action. In your zombieTurn function,
      you must _never_ use getCurrentPlayerId() or getCurrentPlayerName(), otherwise it will fail with a "Not logged" error message.
